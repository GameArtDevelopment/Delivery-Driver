Short N Stubby Character Base Overview
--------------------------------------
This pack will receive updates (addition or updated sprites/animations)

Sprites created with 16x16 tilesets in mind.

Folders contain:
- Individual PNG files for hands, effects, and test weapons as separate files to layer on your sprite/spawn
in game
- Sprite sheets (white & 20 skin tones)
- GIFs of animations as they are envisioned/recommended (of course, use however you want)

Use the provided Skin Tones chart to sort through folders. Each skin tone is assigned
a number that corresponds with a matching folder for in the Animations folder and the
Hands Separate folder.

This pack goes well with many of my other packs, so please check out the shop for 
additional things like weapons, outfits, items, etc.

Credit is not necessary, but if you create something using this sprite pack I'd 
love to see your work (you can comment with a link to your projects, images, etc.).

Should you choose to create 3rd party assets, you must contact me prior to selling. I would
love to see people make things for this character (outfits, hair, armor, etc.) and get
compensated for it. So reach out if you are interested in making 3rd party packs. Full rules
on this are on the store page.
