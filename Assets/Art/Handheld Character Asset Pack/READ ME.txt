Handheld Character Asset Pack Overview
--------------------------------------
The image titled Handheld Character Complete Numbered will show each 
character sprite given a number. That number will correlate each of the 
numbered folders. This way, you can easily find which character you 
want to pull up.

Each Handheld Character folder holds animations as individual 
sprites (each within their own folder and numbered in order of frame) 
and an overall sprite sheet. Some sprites did not make the official release,
but the numbering reflects the proper sprites. Below are instructions for 
interpretingthe sprite sheet (by rows).

Sprite sheets are organized in the following order from Top to Bottom:

Row 1 - Idle facing south (down)
Row 2 - Idle facing north (up)
Row 3 - idle facing east (right)
Row 4 - Idle facing west (left)
Row 5 - Walking south (down)
Row 6 - Walking north (up)
Row 7 - Walking east (right)
Row 8 - Walking west (left)

Sprites are constrained to fit within 16x16

Sprites go well with 8x8 tilesets

Credit is not necessary, but if you create something using this tileset I'd 
love to see your work (you can comment with a link to your projects, images, etc.).
